        <p>
            I am a Principal Research Scientist and Manager at IBM Research, leading the Model Feedback and Adoption initiative 
            for IBM’s Granite AI Models, with a focus on enterprise AI applications. Previously, 
            I led the Edge AI research team, advancing distributed and scalable AI model lifecycles. My research has been published 
            in machine learning and computer vision venues, including NeurIPS, CVPR, and AAAI. My work in multimodal AI led to the 
            creation of the Fashion IQ Challenge, an open-dataset competition featured at ICCV 2019 and CVPR 2020. I co-founded the Workshop 
            on Computer Vision for Fashion, Art, and Design, which was hosted at ECCV 2018, ICCV 2019, and CVPR 2020. 
            Before joining IBM Research in 2015, I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, 
            where my dissertation focused on machine learning and medical image analysis.</p>
