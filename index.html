        <h1 class="top-text">About Hui Wu</h1>
        <p>
            I am a research scientist and a manager at the Distributed MLOps group @ IBM Research. 
            I am passionate about developing new AI applications that drive real-world impact, particulary around Edge AI use cases. 
            My current interest includes vision and language, neural-symbolic learning, computer vision for fashion and more
            recently, distributed MLOps. 
            I joined IBM Research since 2015, and worked in the computer vision and multimedia group at 
            <a href=https://www.research.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence/>IBM Research AI</a> (2015-2020), and 
            <a href=https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/>MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab</a> (2020-2021).
            Prior to joining IBM, I received my PhD in Computer Science from <a href=https://www.uncc.edu/>UNC Charlotte</a>, 
            with a thesis focus on machine learning 
            techniques applied to image set analysis problems.</p>
