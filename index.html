        <h1 class="top-text">About Hui Wu</h1>
        <p>
            I am a manager and Principal Research Scientist at IBM Research. I currently lead the model feedback and adoption 
            initiative for IBM’s Granite AI Models, focusing on Enterprise AI applications. Prior to this, I led the Edge AI research initiative 
            at IBM Research, advancing distributed and scalable AI model lifecycles. As a research scientist, I have published papers in 
            machine learning and computer vision conferences, including NeurIPS, CVPR, and AAAI. My work in multimodal AI led to the 
            creation of the Fashion IQ Challenge, an open-dataset competition featured at ICCV 2019 and CVPR 2020. I have served as the lead 
            organizer of the Workshop on Computer Vision for Fashion, Art, and Design at ECCV 2018, ICCV 2019, and CVPR 2020. 
            Before joining IBM Research in 2015, I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, 
            where my dissertation focused on machine learning and medical image analysis.</p>
